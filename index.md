## Hello there 👋

Welcome to my living knowledge base - a space for every idea & discovery I make and collect.

**Oh My Tidbits** is a public workspace for ideas in progress; a living digital garden of interlinked notes.  

I see writing as a way to think—each note helps me untangle ideas, ignite fresh connections, and deepen my understanding.
So each tidbit evolves over time as concepts are tested, challenged, and refined. You’ll find a living web of linked tidbits here, each unfolding at its own pace. Don’t mind the occasional misstep, garden grows strongest by questioning assumptions and refining mental models
